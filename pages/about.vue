            Tutorials Point originated from the idea that there exists a class
            of readers who respond better to online content and prefer to learn
            new skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing
            rooms. The journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in 2006
            and elated by the response it generated, we worked our way to adding
            fresh tutorials to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth
            of tutorials and allied articles on topics ranging from programming
            languages to web designing to academics and much more. 40 million
            readers read 100 million pages every month Our Text Library Content
            and resources are freely available and we prefer to keep it that way
            to encourage our readers acquire as many skills as they would like
            to. We don't force our readers to sign up with us or submit their
            details either to use our Free Text Tutorials Library. No
            preconditions and no impediments, Just Simply Easy Learning! We have
